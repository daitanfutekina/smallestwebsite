school/grade: idea north mission, 9th grade
<br>
I want to learn how to code, and a weekly class aught to the push to do so.
<br>
I'm planning to be a lawyer in the future, and id like to be able to write programs to help automate small tedious jobs with the paperwork and other tasks, and before then maybe even join a dev team, definitely not a game developer though.
<br>
I understand my computer very well and I'm glad I got a windows computer instead of an apple laptop, you have way more control on windows if that says anything about my experience with computers.
</p>
my career plan
<li>complete college and get a law degree</li>
<li>serve in military, will help pay debt and since id be a colloge grad ill alreadly be a rank above zero</li>
<li>join a law firm and potentailly create one</li>
<li>go to seperate schooling for being a judge and be one of those guys when nearing retirement</li>
    typically I prefer science or history classes because they have a logic behind them I like math but only to a point to where I understand what's happening behind the equations memorizing equations to use them together isn't really fun, although compared to science and history science always has an explanation or at least to a setting in a classroom and history besides the dates and names of things has a set motion of things even if something outrageously awful happens in history you understand how it happened and why they did that. 

i also do a bunch of volenteer work and are with the scouts and working on getting the eagle rank </h3>
